      "description": "Sunset Roasters is excited to bring you its first coffee from the Asian region. Loaded with wonderful fruity and floral tones this coffee is an immediate standout. Bali Organic Kintamani natural is sourced from family owned farms located in the Kintamani highlands on the island province of Bali, Indonesia. Coffee is grown in the volcanic soils of Mount Agung along with citrus trees that provide shade and another source of income.  Coffee production is typically organized around a Subak Abian, which refers to the ecologically sustainable irrigation systems developed more than 1,000 years ago by Hindu priests who practiced Tri Hita Karana (the three sources of prosperity), a philosophy focused on the harmonization between the environment, humans, and God. Sunset Roasters brings Bali Kintamani coffee to you to sip, and savor, and share with friends.",
